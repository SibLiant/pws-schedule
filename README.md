I had a use case where the client had data in a postgresql database and needed a nice  schedule view on that data.  The client had a series of installation teams that were on a job site for anywhere from 1 day to a few weeks for installation.  

Objective - After installation a client coder should be able to either manually post schedule data to the database ( via chrome extension postman for example ).  Or write some php code that pulls json data from their own data source and posts that data to the web server api then forwards the user to a url that can display that data nicely.
